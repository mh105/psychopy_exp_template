# PsychoPy Task Template

This repository is a **minimal template** for a single PsychoPy experiment.

The idea is that when you use this as a template (or clone it), your final
task repo will look something like:

```text
.
├─ resource/                 # all stimuli used in the task
│    ├─ images/              # (optional) image files
│    ├─ sounds/              # (optional) audio files
│    └─ ...                  # any other stimulus files
├─ my_experiment.psyexp      # PsychoPy Builder file
├─ my_experiment.py          # full experiment script (generated by Builder)
├─ .gitignore
└─ README.md
```

# Example Builder Layout (N-back Task)

Here's an example PsychoPy **Builder** flow for a simple N-back task.\
This is the general structure we recommend for most experiments:

`__start__ → welcome → practiceIntro → [practice loop: trial + feedback]
          → trialIntro → [trials loop: trial]
          → __end__`

In Builder this looks like:

-   A row of **routines** (blue boxes)

-   A couple of **loops** (gray boxes) wrapped around them:

    -   An outer block loop: `nbackBlocks`

    -   Inner loops for practice and main trials: `practice`, `trials`

## Below is what each part is for.

#### `__start__` (init / housekeeping)

-   Runs once at the very beginning.

-   Good place (in Code components) to:

    -   Set up your condition lists.

    -   Create block structures (e.g., 0-back vs 1-back).

    -   Initialize counters, timers, and data structures.

You usually don't show anything to the participant here; it's mostly logic.

* * * * *

#### `welcome` (general instructions)

-   First screen the participant sees.

-   Use Text + Keyboard components.

-   Explain the overall task (e.g., "You will see letters... press X when...").

-   Typically waits for a key press (e.g., `space`) to continue.

This is also a good place to show a "Press any key to begin" message.

* * * * *

#### `practiceIntro` (explain the practice block)

-   Runs **once per block** before practice starts (inside `nbackBlocks`).

-   Explains what kind of block this is:

    -   e.g., "This is the 0-back practice block. Press the key when you see H."

    -   e.g., "This is the 1-back practice block. Press the key if the letter matches the previous one."

-   You can use a Code component here to:

    -   Read the current `n_back` level from the outer loop.

    -   Customize the text depending on whether it's 0-back or 1-back.

* * * * *

#### `practice` loop (short block of trial + feedback)

Loop: **`practice`**\
Routines inside: `trial` → `feedback`

-   **`trial` routine**

    -   Shows the stimulus for one practice trial (letter, flankers, etc.).

    -   Collects the participant's response and RT.

    -   Uses your conditions file (e.g., `practice_0back.csv`, `practice_1back.csv`).

-   **`feedback` routine**

    -   Runs right after each practice trial.

    -   Shows feedback like:

        -   "Correct!"

        -   "Incorrect"

        -   "Too slow"

    -   Uses the response from `trial` (e.g., via a Code component) to decide what text to show.

The practice loop usually has a small number of trials (e.g., 10--20) so participants can learn the task.

* * * * *

#### `nbackBlocks` (outer block loop)

Loop: **`nbackBlocks`** wraps around:

`welcome → practiceIntro → practice loop → trialIntro → trials loop`

Typical pattern:

-   First repetition: `n_back = 0` (0-back block)

-   Second repetition: `n_back = 1` (1-back block)

Inside a Code component at the beginning of each block you can:

-   Pick which condition file to use for practice and trials.

-   Update the instructions text (0-back vs 1-back).

-   Send block start triggers if needed.

This is what lets you reuse the *same routines* for multiple block types.

* * * * *

#### `trialIntro` (main block instructions)

-   Runs once per block, after practice is finished.

-   Gives "real" instructions for the main trials:

    -   e.g., "Now the real block begins. You will no longer see feedback. Try to be both fast and accurate."

-   Same structure as `practiceIntro`, but focused on the main task.

* * * * *

#### `trials` loop (main experimental trials)

Loop: **`trials`**\
Routine inside: `trial` (same as in practice, but **no feedback** afterwards)

-   Presents the actual experimental trials.

-   Uses the main conditions file (e.g., `trials_0back.csv`, `trials_1back.csv`).

-   Typically has many more trials (e.g., 60--200+).

-   Uses the same `trial` routine as practice, but:

    -   You usually turn off the `feedback` routine here,

    -   Or simply don't include it in this loop.

All main data that you'll analyze later (accuracy, RT, condition, block type, etc.) are captured here.

* * * * *

#### `__end__` (thanks / wrap-up)

-   Final screen at the end of the experiment.

-   Good place to:

    -   Say "Thank you for participating."

    -   Tell the participant they can call the experimenter.

-   You can also add cleanup Code here (saving extra logs, triggers, etc.).

## How to Adapt This Layout for Your Own Task

When you create a new experiment from this template, we recommend:

1.  **Keep the same overall flow**:

    -   `__start__` → instructions → practice → main trials → end.

2.  **Rename routines/loops** to match your task:

    -   `nbackBlocks` → `taskBlocks`, etc.

3.  **Swap in your own conditions files**:

    -   Your CSV files in `resource/` or `conditions/`.

4.  **Update text components** in `welcome`, `practiceIntro`, `trialIntro`, and `__end__` to describe your task.

This pattern (start → practice → main → end, with a block loop) generalizes well to almost any RT experiment, not just N-back.
